If you want to get in touch, then <a href="mailto:tkober@inf.ed.ac.uk"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i><span> email</span></a> is perhaps the best option. While I rarely manage to get to <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Inbox%20Zero" target="_blank">Inbox Zero</a>, I am quite good at replying within a few days.

The most up-to-date list of my publications is typically on my <a href="https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=1YCMKBgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-university"></i><span> Google Scholar profile</span></a>, though I do try to keep [this website](./publications) up-to-date too. 

I generally publish code and other resources on <a href="https://github.com/tttthomasssss/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i><span> Github</span></a>. 

From time to time I tend to answer questions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1150479/tttthomasssss" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-stack-overflow"></i><span> Stackoverflow</span></a>, and I'm relatively proud of myself of having made it into the top 9% overall with my score!

I also maintain a classy presence on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kober-18450617/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i><span> LinkedIn</span></a> and <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Thomas_Kober5/"  target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-xing"></i><span> Xing</span></a>. An arguably less classy presence is my <a href="https://twitter.com/tttthomasssss" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i><span> Twitter profile</span></a>, which however is perhaps the second best way of contacting me.
